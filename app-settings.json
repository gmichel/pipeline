As part of our efforts to help address the ongoing pandemic, we are creating a public resource of immune signatures related to COVID-19. In particular, we would like to include\\n\\n{{paper}}\\n\\nin the initial database release. To help our curators enter it correctly, we would greatly appreciate if you or one of your collaborators could help by filling out the brief form at http://covid-signatures.org/entry/{{id}} to make sure we get all the tissues, cohorts, etc. We expect it would only take a few minutes for your team, but it will greatly improve the quality of our listing.\\n\\nOnce you submit your signature, our team will leverage this information to manually curate your paper and extract additional details to make the research results available to the wider scientific community in a machine-readable, fully searchable format. This will increase the utility (and visibility) of your work in the effort to understand COVID-19.\\n\\nIf you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to reach out by replying to this email.\\n\\nThank you in advance for your help,\\n\\nRobert McDougal, Health Informatics Division, Dept of Biostatistics, Yale School of Public Health\\n\\nCC: Steven Kleinstein, Dept of Pathology, Dept of Immunobiology, Yale School of Medicine",
